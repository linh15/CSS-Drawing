# My CSS doodles as a hobby
Drawing with CSS is amazing! It calms me down in stress time and brings me the long-lost childhood joy of drawing.

# Here are live demos of my drawings:

## Doraemon
He's just standing, smiling and being my beloved manga character of all time ;)

First draft of him standing, will add his teddy bear later
